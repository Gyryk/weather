# Weather
## A very basic weather app

#### A simple VueJS/NodeJS website that shows you the weather for any location you want
It uses Node for the backend, Vue for the frontend, and cookies to store the last place you looked up so that when you open the website again it automatically shows you the weather there. <br>
The background changes based on temperature alone, I might add weather conditions as well. <br>
This project has mainly been an adventure in responsive design for me
> I know this is pretty much the most basic project in existence, but I just had to make it ðŸ˜­ <br>
> Don't worry, I won't be making the to-do list as well... No one actually uses them anyways
